    <h1>Vintage Lemonade</h1>
    <img src="lemon.png" alt="20">
    <p>In the 1800's this is how people made lemonade—you can do it too! It's not that difficult, and tastes wonderful!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>5 lemons</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 ¼ quarts water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils from the lemons.
    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to cool for 20 minutes and then remove the rinds.
    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into pitcher and pop it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.
